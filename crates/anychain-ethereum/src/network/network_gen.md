Delete mainnet.rs and testnet.rs

See the mainnet part and the testnet part of the chain_id.md file?

I want you to generate a mainnet.rs file and a testnet.rs file according
to the items in the mainnet part and in the testnet part respectively.

The rule for generating code from one item is in the item_gen.md file.

You should always write "use super::EthereumNetwork;" in the first line
of each .rs file.
