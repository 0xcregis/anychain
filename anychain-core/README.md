# anychain-core

anychain-core is a Rust crate that provides core functionality for working with various blockchain implementations. This crate aims to simplify the process of integrating different blockchain technologies into your projects by providing a unified interface and a set of common utilities.

## Features

- Unified interface for interacting with multiple blockchain implementations
- Support for popular blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.)
- Extensible design for adding custom blockchain implementations
- Utility functions for common tasks (e.g., address validation, transaction signing, etc.)

## Getting Started

To start using anychain-core, add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
anychain-core = "0.1.3"
```

Then, import the crate in your Rust code:
```rust
extern crate anychain_core;
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use anychain-core to interact with an Ethereum blockchain:
```rust
use anychain_core::{Blockchain, Ethereum};

fn main() {
    let eth = Ethereum::new("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-API-KEY");

    let balance = eth.get_balance("0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e").unwrap();
    println!("Balance: {}", balance);
}
```
