# AnyChain Ethereum Crate

`anychain-ethereum` is a Rust crate that provides a simple and efficient way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This library aims to make it easy for developers to build applications that require Ethereum data and functionality without having to deal with the complexities of the underlying protocol.

This is the README for the anychain-ethereum crate, a Rust library that provides a simple and efficient way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Easy interaction with Ethereum nodes
- Support for multiple Ethereum networks (Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.)
- Sending and receiving transactions
- Querying contract data
- Deploying and interacting with smart contracts
- Support for popular Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor)

## Installation

To use the anychain-ethereum crate in your Rust project, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
anychain-ethereum = "0.1.2"
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the anychain-ethereum crate to interact with the Ethereum blockchain:
```rust
use anychain_ethereum::{Ethereum, Network};

fn main() {
    // Create an Ethereum instance for the desired network
    let eth = Ethereum::new(Network::Mainnet);

    // Get the balance of an Ethereum address
    let address = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e".parse().unwrap();
    let balance = eth.get_balance(&address).unwrap();
    println!("Balance: {} ETH", balance);
}
```
